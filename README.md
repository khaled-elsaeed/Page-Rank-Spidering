Certainly! Here's a sample description you can use for your project:

# Simple Python Search Spider, Page Ranker, and Visualizer

This Python project encompasses a set of programs designed to mimic the functionality of a basic search engine. The primary components include a web crawler, a page rank algorithm, and a visualization tool. The data is stored efficiently in an SQLITE3 database named 'spider.sqlite', allowing for seamless retrieval and analysis.

## Features

- **Web Crawler**: The `spider.py` script allows users to crawl a specified website, pulling in a series of pages into the 'spider.sqlite' database. It intelligently records the links between pages, ensuring efficient navigation.

- **Page Ranker**: The `sprank.py` script implements the Page Rank algorithm on the stored pages, providing a numerical ranking for each page based on link structures. Users can run the algorithm for multiple iterations to refine the page ranks.

- **Visualization**: The `spjson.py` script generates a JSON output that can be visualized in a web browser using the 'force.html' file. The visualization, powered by D3.js, presents an automatic layout of nodes and links, allowing users to interactively explore the relationships between pages.

- **Database Dump**: The `spdump.py` script enables users to dump the contents of the 'spider.sqlite' database, showing details such as incoming links, old page rank, new page rank, page ID, and URL.

### Prerequisites

- SQLite Browser

- Beautiful Soup

- D3.js
